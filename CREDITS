PPLite is a library derived from the PPL (Parma Polyhedra Library).
The initial development team was composed by:

Anna Becchi            (former student of the University of Parma)
Enea Zaffanella        (associate professor of the University of Parma)

The team started working soon after Anna obtained her Bachelor Degree
in Computer Science at the University of Parma (September 2017), with
a thesis describing the new DD representation and conversion algorithm
for NNC polyhedra, which are the main improvements of PPLite wrt PPL.
Currently the library is maintained by Enea Zaffanella.

Students collaborate to the development of the library (in a broad
sense, which is sometimes different from writing source code), under
supervision of Enea Zaffanella, during their internship (tirocinio
curriculare) and/or the activities related to the final exam of the
Bachelor and/or Master Degree in Computer Science (Laurea triennale
in Informatica e/o Laurea Magistrale in Scienze Informatiche).
